### Hi there 👋

My name is Martha 😀, and I'm a graduate of the Front-End Web Development program at BCIT in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

📍 You can find my **portfolio** here: [martha.codes](https://www.martha.codes/)

🎶 💃 🥾 **When I'm not coding, you'll find me:**
- Playing music: I'm a music enthusiast and love playing various instruments.
- Dancing flamenco: The rhythm and energy of flamenco dance fuel my creativity.
- Hiking: Exploring the great outdoors helps me find inspiration in nature.

Feel free to connect with me! Let's collaborate and build amazing web experiences together. 😄
